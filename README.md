# School Environment Management System Project

### What is this project?

The idea of this project is to simulate an online system where the teacher can enter attendance, grades, and notes about students at a school.

If the teacher inserts incorrect data, they will not obtain access to the system. The teacher's entry will be restricted, requiring them to re-enter the data correctly. This prevents unauthorized access that could accidentally or intentionally sabotage the data. Now if the data that the teacher inserted is correct,he will acess the classes of the school he works.

### Why was this project created?

As a Brazilian high school student, I have often seen teachers complain about the system used at my school.
My interest in software development arose during my IT technical course at the school where I am currently studying.

The problem that is proposed to solve here is to reduce the size and make the structure of databases of school environment management systems more lighter and simple. At this form,the system will not be overloaded and the chances of fails occurring due to programming errors will be lower.

So, I came up with this project idea to learn more about how full-stack programming works.
