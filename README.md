<h1>School System Project (English Translation)</h1>


<h3>What is this project ?</h3>

<p>The idea of ​​this project is to simply simulate an online system where the teacher can enter attendance, notes and observations about the students at a school. When a certain number of days pass, the system will display the grades, number of absences and observation notes about the students. The teacher's entry will be prevented and he will need to re-enter the data, but correctly. This prevents anyone from accessing the system and sabotaging the data, whether accidentally or intentionally. </p>

<h3>Why was this project done ?</h3>

<p>As a Brazilian high school student, I saw teachers' complaints several times about the system that my school uses. My interest in software development awoke during my IT technical course at the school where I am currently studying. So, I had this project idea, so I could learn more about how full-stack programming works.</p>
